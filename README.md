This Python script generates UV-mapping guides for a rectangular box (e.g., freight container, vehicle body, crate) based on real-world dimensions.
It creates a 2048×2048 PNG showing each face’s outline, safe area, and seam alignment, plus a JSON file describing exact UV coordinates for texture mapping or 3D workflows.
